# Abstract

Since the first release of R on CRAN, in 1997, its use in many fields has grown rapidly. Lai et al. (2019), for example, suggest that more than 50% of research articles published in Ecology use R in some way. Much like many ecological datasets, transport data tend to be large, diverse and have spatial and temporal attributes. Unlike Ecology, Transport Planning has been a slow adopter of R, with a much lower percentage of papers using the language. This raises the question: why? After exploring this question, in relation to dominant transport planning software products, the talk will sketch of what an open source transport planning 'ecosystem' could look like. Based on my own experience, of developing the stplanr package and teaching practitioners, the talk will discuss the importance of building â€˜communities of practice', for transport planners making the switch to R. These observations relate to others promoting R in new environments, and link to the wider question of how to advocate for open source software in wider society.

### The four stage model

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fourstage.png")
```

Still dominates transport planning models (Boyce and Williams 2015)

### Impacting the durrent software landscape

- Dominated by a few proprietary products

- Limited support community online 

- High degree of lock-in

- Limited cross-department collaboration

---

# Existing products

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tms = readr::read_csv("transport-software.csv")[1:5]
tms = dplyr::arrange(tms, dplyr::desc(Citations))
knitr::kable(tms, booktabs = TRUE, caption = "Sample of transport modelling software in use by practitioners. Note: citation counts based on searches for company/developer name, the product name and 'transport'. Data source: Google Scholar searches, October 2018.", format = "html")
```

# User support

Getting help is vital for leaning/improving software

# Online communities

- [gis.stackexchange.com](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions) has 21,314 questions 

- [r-sig-geo](http://r-sig-geo.2731867.n2.nabble.com/) has 1000s of posts

- RStudio's Discourse community has 65,000+ posts already!

--

- No transport equivalent (e.g. earthscience.stackexchange.com is in beta)

- Potential for a Discourse forum or similar: transport is not (just) GIS

# Best way to get support is peer-to-peer:

# Loading the tracks

```{r}
library(sf)
```


```{r dl}
u = "https://www.openstreetmap.org/trace/2882954/data"
if(!file.exists("trace.gpx")) download.file(u, "trace.gpx")

### Static plotting

```{r, out.width="50%", fig.show='hold', warning=FALSE}

### 'Data science' approach to transport modelling

- Problem: gpx files do not always contain speed

```{r}
points2line_trajectory = function(p) {
  c = st_coordinates(p)
  i = seq(nrow(p) - 2)
  l = purrr::map(i, ~ sf::st_linestring(c[.x:(.x + 1), ]))
  s = purrr::map_dbl(i, function(x) {
    geosphere::distHaversine(c[x, ], c[(x + 1), ]) /
      as.numeric(p$time[x + 1] - p$time[x])
  }
  )
  lfc = sf::st_sfc(l)
  a = seq(length(lfc)) + 1 # sequence to subset
  p_data = cbind(sf::st_set_geometry(p[a, ], NULL), s)
  sf::st_sf(p_data, geometry = lfc)
}
```

## Creating lines with attributes

```{r}
l = points2line_trajectory(p = track_points)
plot(l["s"])
```

---

## All slow sections

```{r}
l_slow = l[l$s < 20, ]
plot(l_slow["s"])
```

---

## Interactive plot!

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tmap)
ttm()
tm_shape(l_slow) +
  tm_lines(col = "s", palette = "magma", n = 9)
```
