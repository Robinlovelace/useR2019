# Abstract

<font color="grey"></font>
<font color="grey">Since the first release of R on CRAN, in 1997, its use in many fields has grown rapidly. Lai et al. (2019), for example, suggest that </font> more than 50% of research articles published in Ecology use R <font color="grey"> in some way.

--

Much like many ecological datasets, </font>transport datasets tend to be large, diverse and have spatial and temporal attributes.<font color="grey">

--

Unlike Ecology, Transport Planning has been a slow adopter of R, with a much lower percentage of papers using the language. This raises the question: why? After exploring this question, in relation to dominant transport planning software products, the talk will sketch of what an open source transport planning 'ecosystem' could look like. Based on my own experience, of developing the stplanr package and teaching practitioners, the talk will discuss the importance of building </font>'communities of practice, for transport planners making the switch to R<font color="grey">. These observations relate to others promoting R in new environments, and link to the wider question of how to advocate for open source software in wider society.</font>

# Transport emissions

> With-out  aggressive  and  sustained  mitigation  policies  being  implemented,  transport  sector  emissions  could  increase  faster  than  in  the  other  energy end-use sectors and could lead to more than a doubling of CO2 emissions by 2050. ([IPCC, 2015](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_full.pdf))

--

Transport is hard to decarbonise  (Creutzig et al. [2015](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6263/911))

--

Technological change is slow and uncertain.
Demand reduction is required. 

International Energy Agency's optimistic '[SDS](https://www.iea.org/weo/weomodel/sds/)' scenario:

```{r, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4}
transport_data = read_csv("transport-emissions-iea.csv")
transport_data$scenario = "Observed"

g = ggplot(transport_data) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = gtco2))

# Why transport planning with R?

- Integration of most transport planning tasks into a single workflow. For example, the Propensity to Cycle Tool ([www.pct.bike](http://www.pct.bike/)) (Lovelace et al. 2017; Goodman et al. 2019)

.pull-left[

- Geographic data

  - Strong geo community
- Reproducibility
  - Transport is inherently part of the democratic process 

- Good transport decision making requires public understanding. R is outstanding at visualisation.

## +There is a growing R-transport community

<!-- list pkgs here -->

???

 R has a strong and cohesive spatial community
 
 Transport is inherently part of the democratic desision-making process making transparency key. Reproducibility is a strength of R.

# Where next for R-transport?

# Questions and suggestions

- Shift focus to communication of what's *already possible*

- 'Dev story' of existing products: A 'Better planning in less time' article, building on Lowndes et al. ([2017](https://jules32.github.io/opensci-talk/short#1))? E.g. for ([PCT.bike](http://www.pct.bike/)) 

- For developers: invite others to contribute and open issues

- For potential developers: consider contributing to existing projects before creating new ones

- For everyone: cite code, communicate, collaborate

--

## Questions

- Is there a need for a 'transportverse'?
- How can we best take this forward?
